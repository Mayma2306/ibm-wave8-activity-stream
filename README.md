Events keep happening - take for example elections, disasters,  and the best we can do is to take immediate actions. The time span between the occurrence of an event and the response taken by stakeholders is critical. The greater the time, the greater the negative impact of the event.
Also for an event, there are different stakeholders.
Each such stakeholders perform different actions and therefore have different information needs.
The problem is how to:
## Collect and process the information on events quickly enough to allow fast decision-making?
## How to categorize information on events and map them to the appropriate stakeholder?
## How to ensure the credibility of information on events?
## What we need is a reactive data processing pipeline. The system should consume data from a wide variety of sources, perform processing and analytics, before sending it to a sink.
